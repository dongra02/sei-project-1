# Don't Get Poo on Your Shoe

## Game Outline

Don't Get Poo on Your Shoe is designed to replicate Minesweeper, with a silly theme. The game takes place on a grid, in this case a 'lawn.' The objective is to clear the lawn by clicking grid cells, while avoiding clicking cell containing a mine. The first click will always be safe, and will reveal information related to the quantity of mines contained by the clicked item's neighboring cells. Neighbors include cells directly above, to side, below as well as corners. Thus a cell can have a maximimum of 8 neighbors, though cells along the border will have fewer.
